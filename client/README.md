# Reusable components created in React

This repository is initialized as a list of reusable components created in React.

This project utilizes reusability, css in js (styled library), tree shaking, routing, etc.

Note: The project is recently initialized so the list is still short, but will be updated with more components.

All you need to do is copy the component that you wish to use from the "Components" folder and import it to your main app.
